Causal EDA: Soccer Substitution Impact Analysis

This script performs exploratory data analysis focused on causal inference for
understanding the impact of player substitutions on soccer team performance.

Key Focus Areas:
- Causal structure validation
- Confounder analysis
- Treatment assignment mechanism
- Heterogeneous treatment effects
- Causal assumptions validation
